# Loan-Payback-Prediction-Using-Keras-API

# 1.Introduction
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

You can also use clone this project to download all the required plugins and datasets:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lauvindra/Loan-Payback-Prediction-Using-Keras-API.git
```

# 2. Objective 
* To build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan.
* To get a new potential customer that can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan in the future.

# 3. Keras API 
Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.

# 4. Feature Engineering
Features are usually in the form of structured columns. Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly.There are 2 main reasons for feature engineering :
* Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements.
* Improving the performance of machine learning models.
